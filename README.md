# 🏛️ SAMRIDDHI – Unified AI-Enabled E-Governance Portal

SAMRIDDHI is a unified, AI-enabled, citizen-centric e-governance web platform designed to simplify access to government welfare schemes, public services, grievance redressal, and emergency support.

The platform focuses on **accessibility, multilingual inclusion, transparency, and ease of use**, especially for rural citizens, senior citizens, and digitally underserved communities.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Despite the availability of numerous government welfare schemes and public services, many citizens remain unaware of the benefits they are entitled to. Information is scattered across multiple portals, written in complex language, and difficult to navigate.

Additionally:
- Grievance redressal systems are fragmented and slow  
- Language barriers limit accessibility  
- Low digital literacy increases dependency on intermediaries  
- Emergency helpline information is not centralized

## 💡 Proposed Solution

SAMRIDDHI provides a **single, unified digital platform** that enables citizens to:
- Discover welfare schemes they are eligible for
- Understand eligibility criteria and required documents
- File and track grievances transparently
- Access government document services
- Find emergency and SOS helpline numbers
- Use the platform in **multiple Indian regional languages**
